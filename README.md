## 🚀 What is Lead Orchestra?



Lead Orchestra is an open-source scraping engine built for modern growth teams and developers.



You paste a URL (or list of URLs) → Lead Orchestra scrapes the pages → it normalizes & cleans the data → you export it (CSV/JSON) or push to your pipeline (e.g., for enrichment in Deal Scale).



> Unlike traditional paid databases, you control the datasource — no credits, no rented lists, no stale data.



---



## 🔍 Why It Matters



- **Outdated data**, generic lists and high costs plague outbound teams.  

- **Scraping on your own** has been hard, brittle and complex.  

- Lead Orchestra gives you *fresh*, *untouched*, *niche-specific* leads — an unfair advantage.



---



## ✨ Features



- **MCP Plugin Architecture**: Add new "provider" scrapers easily.  

- **Lead Standard Format (LSF)**: All output normalized (name, email, phone, company, website, source, timestamp).  

- **One-click scrape**: Enter URL(s), hit "Scrape", get results.  

- **Export**: CSV / JSON download.  

- **Upgrade-ready**: Send exported results to Deal Scale for enrichment, scoring, AI-follow-up.  

- **Open Source**: No vendor lock-in, fully transparent.

- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Beautiful analytics and visualization of scraping performance

- **Multi-Source Scraping**: BiggerPockets forums, business directory, user profiles, and more

- **AI-Powered Extraction**: ScrapeGraphAI integration for intelligent data extraction

- **Proxy Support**: Bright Data SDK integration for bypassing rate limits

- **Stealth Browsers**: Camoufox and Lightpanda support for anti-detection scraping
