# Landing Page Copy Update Plan
## Based on Business Notes - Using TOON & POML

**Created:** 2025-01-21  
**Status:** Planning  
**Objective:** Update landing page copy to reflect Lead Orchestra business model, positioning, and value propositions from business notes

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

This plan outlines the systematic update of the Lead Orchestra landing page copy to align with the business model documented in the Business Model Notes. The update will use **TOON (Token Oriented Object Notation)** for structured data representation and **POML (Project Orchestration Markup Language)** for workflow orchestration.

---

## 🎯 Key Business Model Points to Reflect

### 1. Dual-Engine Business Model
- **Engine 1:** Open-Source Freemium (Distribution Engine)
  - Free, open-source, local-first
  - MCP-based, developer-friendly
  - Zero marginal cost per user
  - Community-powered growth

- **Engine 2:** Deal Scale AI Monetization (Revenue Engine)
  - Natural upsell to Deal Scale
  - Enrichment, scoring, AI follow-up
  - CRM sync, automations

### 2. Core Positioning
- **Tagline:** "Open-source lead scraping and data ingestion that plugs into anything"
- **Value Prop:** The open-source engine that powers your lead pipeline
- **Differentiation:** Not a CRM, AI engine, or outreach tool - ONLY data ingestion layer

### 3. Target Audiences (ICP)
- Developers needing reliable scraping + schemas
- Lead-gen agencies (SEO, recruiting, real estate, local services)
- Startups needing scraping without compliance-heavy infrastructure
- Enterprise Data Teams (RevOps, SDR, Growth)

### 4. Key Features to Highlight
- MCP server framework
- Playwright + proxy adapter
- CLI tools
- Standardized TOON/JSON output schemas
- Plugin ecosystem
- Open-source templates
- Developer SDKs
