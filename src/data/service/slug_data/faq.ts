	},
	{
		question: 'How is this different from just buying lists from a list broker?',
		answer:
			"Deal Scale is a dynamic, all-in-one platform, not a static list provider. While list brokers provide a one-time data dump that quickly becomes outdated, our database is constantly updated. Furthermore, our AI-powered filters and lead scoring allow you to build highly targeted, high-potential lists on demand and seamlessly push them into automated outreach campaigns. It's the difference between being handed a phone book and being given a GPS that leads you directly to the best deals. [1, 2, 3]",
	},
	{
		question: 'How does the AI Lead Scoring work?',
		answer:
			'Our AI analyzes thousands of data points for each property, including ownership history, loan information, local market trends, and other behavioral indicators.

	{
		question: 'Can I target a specific neighborhood or zip code?',

		{
			question: 'What are AI Credits used for?',
			answer:

		{
			question: 'How does the pricing work?',
			answer:
				"Our model is simple. You pay a low, flat monthly fee for your dedicated AI-powered phone number. Then, you use flexible 'AI Credits' to pay for the time the AI is actively engaged on a call (2 credits per minute). There are no hidden fees.",
		},
		{
			question: 'Can I use my existing business phone number?',
			answer:
				'Yes, absolutely. You can simply forward your existing business line to your new Deal Scale AI number. Your customers continue to call the number they already know, and our AI handles the rest seamlessly.',
		},
		{
			question: 'Can the AI transfer a call to a live person?',
			answer:

		},
		{
			question: 'What happens if a caller has a very specific or complex question?',
			answer:
				"The AI is trained to recognize the limits of its knowledge. If it encounters a question it can't answer, its primary goal is to intelligently route the caller. It can offer to schedule a call with the right expert or perform a hot transfer to a live agent immediately.",
