		{
			"question": "Can this dashboard integrate with our existing accounting or property management software?",
			"answer": "Yes. Our Enterprise plan includes API access, allowing you to create custom integrations to sync data between Deal Scale and your existing systems like Yardi, AppFolio, or your internal accounting software."

		{
			"question": "Is there a limit to the number of properties or users we can have?",
			"answer": "Our platform is built to scale. The Enterprise plan is designed for large portfolios and includes unlimited property tracking and custom user seats to fit your organization's structure."
