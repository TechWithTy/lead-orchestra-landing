		{
			"question": "How are leads from SMS campaigns passed to my sales team?",
			"answer": "Leads qualified by the AI via SMS can trigger notifications to your team, be automatically updated in your integrated CRM with conversation history, or even initiate other automated actions within Deal Scale, like adding them to an AI call campaign."

		{
			"question": "Do I need to get my own phone number for sending texts?",
			"answer": "While you can often use a shared shortcode or pooled numbers for some campaigns, we typically recommend and can help provision a dedicated local or toll-free number for your campaigns to improve deliverability and brand recognition."
