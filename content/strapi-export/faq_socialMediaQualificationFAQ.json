			"question": "Is this compliant with Meta's (Facebook/Instagram) policies?",
			"answer": "Yes, 100%. Our system uses the official Meta API for Messenger, which is the approved and compliant way to build messaging automations. Your account's safety is our top priority."

		{
			"question": "Can the AI reply to comments on my posts and ads?",
			"answer": "Absolutely. You can configure the agent to post a public reply to a comment (e.g., 'Thanks, I've just sent you a DM!') and simultaneously initiate a private conversation in their direct messages to start the qualification process."

		{
			"question": "How customizable are the automated conversations?",
			"answer": "Currently, advanced workflow and conversation customizations are only available for our Enterprise members. If you're interested in these features, please contact our team to discuss an upgrade."

			"answer": "Our AI can automatically schedule an appointment with your team or initiate a hot transfer to a live representative, ensuring interested leads are promptly connected to a real person without any manual intervention."
